## Exercise 3 - Robustness and resilience

This part of the PCF 201 Workshop focuses on the topic of robustness and resilience. In this part of the workshop you will learn to:

- Deploy an application
- Make it degrade and restore gracefully instead of becoming unresponsive in case of downstream component failures
- Prevent overloads of downstream components
- Limit resource usage to predefined limits
- Use an inline cache to limit downstream traffic and become less dependent on downstream components
